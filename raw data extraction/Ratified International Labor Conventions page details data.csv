Contracts involving the expenditure of public funds of an amount not exceeding a limit fixed by the competent authority after consultation with the organisations of employers and workers concerned, where such exist, may be exempted from the application of this Convention.5. The competent authority may, after consultation with the organisations of employers and workers concerned, where such exist, exclude from the application of this Convention persons occupying positions of management or of a technical, professional or scientific character, whose conditions of employment are not regulated by national laws or regulations, collective agreement or arbitration award and who do not ordinarily perform manual work.Article 21.

The competent authority may, after consultation with the organisations of employers and employed persons directly concerned, if such exist, exclude from the application of all or any of the provisions of the Convention categories of persons whose circumstances and conditions of employment are such that the application to them of all or any of the said provisions would be inappropriate and who are not employed in manual labour or are employed in domestic service or work similar thereto.3.

Wages payable in money shall be paid only in legal tender, and payment in the form of promissory notes, vouchers or coupons, or in any other form alleged to represent legal tender, shall be prohibited.2.

National laws or regulations, collective agreements or arbitration awards may authorise the partial payment of wages in the form of allowances in kind in industries or occupations in which payment in the form of such allowances is customary or desirable because of the nature of the industry or occupation concerned; the payment of wages in the form of liquor of high alcoholic content or of noxious drugs shall not be permitted in any circumstances.2. In cases in which partial payment of wages in the form of allowances in kind is authorised, appropriate measures shall be taken to ensure that--

Deductions from wages shall be permitted only under conditions and to the extent prescribed by national laws or regulations or fixed by collective agreement or arbitration award.2. Workers shall be informed, in the manner deemed most appropriate by the competent authority, of the conditions under which and the extent to which such deductions may be made.Article 9Any deduction from wages with a view to ensuring a direct or indirect payment for the purpose of obtaining or retaining employment, made by a worker to an employer or his representative or to any intermediary (such as a labour contractor or recruiter), shall be prohibited.Article 101.

Wages shall be protected against attachment or assignment to the extent deemed necessary for the maintenance of the worker and his family.Article 111. In the event of the bankruptcy or judicial liquidation of an undertaking, the workers employed therein shall be treated as privileged creditors either as regards wages due to them for service rendered during such a period prior to the bankruptcy or judicial liquidation as may be prescribed by national laws or regulations, or as regards wages up to a prescribed amount as may be determined by national laws or regulations.2. Wages constituting a privileged debt shall be paid in full before ordinary creditors may establish any claim to a share of the assets.3. The relative priority of wages constituting a privileged debt and other privileged debts shall be determined by national laws or regulations.Article 121. Wages shall be paid regularly. Except where other appropriate arrangements exist which ensure the payment of wages at regular intervals, the intervals for the payment of wages shall be prescribed by national laws or regulations or fixed by collective agreement or arbitration award.2.

			Preamble
		The General Conference of the International Labour Organisation,Having been convened at Geneva by the Governing Body of the International Labour Office, and having met in its Forty-second Session on 4 June 1958, andHaving considered the question of conditions of employment of plantation workers, which is the fifth item on the agenda of the session, andHaving decided that, as an exceptional measure, in order to expedite the application to plantations of certain provisions of existing Conventions, pending the more general ratification of these Conventions and the application of their provisions to all persons within their scope, and to provide for the application to plantations of certain Conventions not at present applicable thereto, it is desirable to adopt an instrument for these purposes, andHaving determined that this instrument shall take the form of an international Convention,adopts this twenty-fourth day of June of the year one thousand nine hundred and fifty-eight the following Convention, which may be cited as the Plantations Convention, 1958:PART I. GENERAL PROVISIONSArticle 11. For the purpose of this Convention, the term plantation includes any agricultural undertaking regularly employing hired workers which is situated in the tropical or subtropical regions and which is mainly concerned with the cultivation or production for commercial purposes of coffee, tea, sugarcane, rubber, bananas, cocoa, coconuts, groundnuts, cotton, tobacco, fibres (sisal, jute and hemp), citrus, palm oil, cinchona or pineapple; it does not include family or small-scale holdings producing for local consumption and not regularly employing hired workers.2. Each Member for which this Convention is in force may, after consultation with the most representative organisations of employers and workers concerned, where such exist, make the Convention applicable to other plantations by--
			(a) adding to the list of crops referred to in paragraph 1 of this Article any one or more of the following crops: rice, chicory, cardamom, geranium and pyrethrum, or any other crop;(b) adding to the plantations covered by paragraph 1 of this Article classes of undertakings not referred to therein which, by national law or practice, are classified as plantations;and shall indicate the action taken in its annual reports upon the application of the Convention submitted under article 22 of the Constitution of the International Labour Organisation.3. For the purpose of this Article the term plantation shall ordinarily include services carrying out the primary processing of the product or products of the plantation.Article 2Each Member which ratifies this Convention undertakes to apply its provisions equally to all plantation workers without distinction as to race, colour, sex, religion, political opinion, nationality, social origin, tribe or trade union membership.Article 31. Each Member for which this Convention is in force--
			(a) shall comply with--
					(i) Part I;(ii) Parts IV, IX and XI;(iii) at least two of Parts II, III, V, VI, VII, VIII, X, XII and XIII; and(iv) Part XIV;(b) shall, if it has excluded one or more Parts from its acceptance of the obligations of the Convention, specify, in a declaration appended to its ratification, the Part or Parts so excluded.2. Each Member which has made a declaration under paragraph 1 (b) of this Article shall indicate in its annual reports submitted under article 22 of the Constitution of the International Labour Organisation any progress made towards the application of the excluded Part or Parts.3. Each Member which has ratified the Convention, but has excluded any Part or Parts thereof under the provisions of the preceding paragraphs, may subsequently notify the Director-General of the International Labour Office that it accepts the obligations of the Convention in respect of any Part or Parts so excluded; such undertakings shall be deemed to be an integral part of the ratification and to have the force of ratification as from the date of notification.Article 4In accordance with Article 19, paragraph 8, of the Constitution of the International Labour Organisation, nothing in this Convention shall affect any law, award, custom or agreement which ensures more favourable conditions to the workers concerned than those provided for by the Convention.PART II. ENGAGEMENT AND RECRUITMENT OF MIGRANT WORKERSArticle 5For the purposes of this Part of this Convention the term recruiting includes all operations undertaken with the object of obtaining or supplying the labour of persons who do not spontaneously offer their services at the place of employment or at a public emigration or employment office or at an office conducted by an employers' organisation and supervised by the competent authority.Article 6The recruiting of the head of a family shall not be deemed to involve the recruiting of any member of his family.Article 7No person or association shall engage in professional recruiting unless the said person or association has been licensed by the competent authority and is recruiting workers for a public department or for one or more specific employers or organisations of employers.Article 8Employers, employers' agents, organisations of employers, organisations subsidised by employers, and the agents of organisations of employers and of organisations subsidised by employers shall only engage in recruiting if licensed by the competent authority.Article 91. Recruited workers shall be brought before a public officer, who shall satisfy himself that the law and regulations concerning recruiting have been observed and, in particular, that the workers have not been subjected to illegal pressure or recruited by misrepresentation or mistake.2. Recruited workers shall be brought before such an officer as near as may be convenient to the place of recruiting or, in the case of workers recruited in one territory for employment in a territory under a different administration, at latest at the place of departure from the territory of recruiting.Article 10Where the circumstances make the adoption of such a provision practicable and necessary, the competent authority shall require the issue to each recruited worker who is not engaged at or near the place of recruiting of a document in writing such as a memorandum of information, a work book or a provisional contract containing such particulars as the authority may prescribe, as for example particulars of the identity of the workers, the prospective conditions of employment, and any advances of wages made to the workers.Article 111. Every recruited worker shall be medically examined.2. Where the worker has been recruited for employment at a distance from the place of recruiting, or has been recruited in one territory for employment in a territory under a different administration, the medical examination shall take place as near as may be convenient to the place of recruiting or, in the case of workers recruited in one territory for employment in a territory under a different administration, at latest at the place of departure from the territory of recruiting.3. The competent authority may empower public officers before whom workers are brought in pursuance of Article 9 to authorise the departure prior to medical examination of workers in whose case they are satisfied--
			(a) that it was and is impossible for the medical examination to take place near to the place of recruiting or at the place of departure;(b) that the worker is fit for the journey and the prospective employment; and (c) that the worker will be medically examined on arrival at the place of employment or as soon as possible thereafter.4. The competent authority may, particularly when the journey of the recruited workers is of such duration and takes place under such conditions that the health of the workers is likely to be affected, require recruited workers to be examined both before departure and after arrival at the place of employment.5. The competent authority shall ensure that all necessary measures are taken for the acclimatisation and adaptation of recruited workers and for their immunisation against disease.Article 121. The recruiter or employer shall whenever possible provide transport to the place of employment for recruited workers.2. The competent authority shall take all necessary measures to ensure--
			(a) that the vehicles or vessels used for the transport of workers are suitable for such transport, are in good sanitary condition and are not overcrowded;(b) that when it is necessary to break the journey for the night suitable accommodation is provided for the workers; and(c) that in the case of long journeys all necessary arrangements are made for medical assistance and for the welfare of the workers.3. When recruited workers have to make long journeys on foot to the place of employment the competent authority shall take all necessary measures to ensure--
			(a) that the length of the daily journey is compatible with the maintenance of the health and strength of the workers; and(b) that, where the extent of the movement of labour makes this necessary, rest camps or rest houses are provided at suitable points on main routes and are kept in proper sanitary condition and have the necessary facilities for medical attention.4. When recruited workers have to make long journeys in groups to the place of employment, they shall be convoyed by a responsible person.Article 131. The expenses of the journey of recruited workers to the place of employment, including all expenses incurred for their protection during the journey, shall be borne by the recruiter or employer.2. The recruiter or employer shall furnish recruited workers with everything necessary for their welfare during the journey to the place of employment, including particularly, as local circumstances may require, adequate and suitable supplies of food, drinking water, fuel and cooking utensils, clothing and blankets.Article 14Any recruited worker who--(a) becomes incapacitated by sickness or accident during the journey to the place of employment,(b) is found on medical examination to be unfit for employment,(c) is not engaged after recruiting for a reason for which he is not responsible, or(d) is found by the competent authority to have been recruited by misrepresentation or mistake,shall be repatriated at the expense of the recruiter or employer.Article 15Where the families of recruited workers have been authorised to accompany the workers to the place of employment the competent authority shall take all necessary measures for safeguarding their health and welfare during the journey and more particularly--(a) Articles 12 and 13 of this Convention shall apply to such families;(b) in the event of the worker being repatriated in virtue of Article 14, his family shall also be repatriated; and(c) in the event of the death of the worker during the journey to the place of employment, his family shall be repatriated.Article 16The competent authority shall limit the amount which may be paid to recruited workers in respect of advances of wages and shall regulate the conditions under which such advances may be made.Article 171. Each Member for which this Part of this Convention is in force undertakes that it will, so far as national laws and regulations permit, take all appropriate steps against misleading propaganda relating to emigration and immigration.2. For this purpose it will, where appropriate, act in co-operation with other Members concerned.Article 18Measures shall be taken as appropriate by each Member, within its jurisdiction, to facilitate the departure, journey and reception of migrants for employment on a plantation.Article 19Each Member for which this Part of this Convention is in force undertakes to maintain, within its jurisdiction, appropriate medical services responsible for--(a) ascertaining, where necessary, both at the time of departure and on arrival, that migrants for employment on a plantation and the members of their families authorised to accompany or join them are in reasonable health;(b) ensuring that migrants for employment on a plantation and members of their families enjoy adequate medical attention and good hygienic conditions at the time of departure, during the journey and on arrival in the territory of destination.PART III. CONTRACTS OF EMPLOYMENT AND ABOLITION OF PENAL SANCTIONSArticle 201. The law and/or regulations in force in the territory concerned shall prescribe the maximum period of service which may be stipulated or implied in any contract, whether written or oral.2. The maximum period of service which may be stipulated or implied in any contract for employment not involving a long and expensive journey shall in no case exceed 12 months if the workers are not accompanied by their families or two years if the workers are accompanied by their families.3. The maximum period of service which may be stipulated or implied in any contract for employment involving a long and expensive journey shall in no case exceed two years if the workers are not accompanied by their families or three years if the workers are accompanied by their families.4. The competent authority may, after consultation with the employers' and workers' organisations representative of the interests concerned, where such exist, exclude from the application of this Part of this Convention contracts entered into between employers and non-manual workers whose freedom of choice in employment is satisfactorily safeguarded; such exclusion may apply to all plantation workers in a territory, to plantation workers engaged in the production of a particular crop, to the workers in any specified undertaking or to special groups of plantation workers.Article 21The competent authority in each country where there exists any penal sanction for any breach of a contract of employment by a plantation worker shall take action for the abolition of all such penal sanctions.Article 22Such action shall provide for the abolition of all such penal sanctions by means of an appropriate measure of immediate application.Article 23For the purpose of this Part of the Convention the term breach of contract means--(a) any refusal or failure of the worker to commence or perform the service stipulated in the contract;(b) any neglect of duty or lack of diligence on the part of the worker;(c) the absence of the worker without permission or valid reason; and(d) the desertion of the worker.PART IV. WAGESArticle 241. The fixing of minimum wages by collective agreements freely negotiated between trade unions which are representative of the workers concerned and employers or employers' organisations shall be encouraged.2. Where no adequate arrangements exist for the fixing of minimum wages by collective agreement, the necessary arrangements shall be made whereby minimum rates of wages can be fixed, where appropriate by means of national laws or regulations, in consultation with representatives of the employers and workers, including representatives of their respective organisations, where such exist, such consultation to be on a basis of complete equality.3. Minimum rates of wages which have been fixed in accordance with arrangements made in pursuance of the preceding paragraph shall be binding on the employers and workers concerned so as not to be subject to abatement.Article 251. Each Member for which this Convention is in force shall take the necessary measures to ensure that the employers and workers concerned are informed of the minimum rates of wages in force and that wages are not paid at less than these rates in cases where they are applicable; these measures shall include such provision for supervision, inspection, and sanctions as may be necessary and appropriate to the conditions obtaining on plantations in the country concerned.2. A worker to whom the minimum rates are applicable and who has been paid wages at less than these rates shall be entitled to recover, by judicial or other appropriate proceedings, the amount by which he has been underpaid, subject to such limitations of time as may be determined by national laws or regulations.Article 26Wages payable in money shall be paid only in legal tender, and payment in the form of promissory notes, vouchers or coupons, or in any other form alleged to represent legal tender, shall be prohibited.Article 271. National laws or regulations, collective agreements or arbitration awards may authorise the partial payment of wages in the form of allowances in kind where payment in the form of such allowances is customary or desirable; the payment of wages in the form of liquor of high alcoholic content or of noxious drugs shall not be permitted in any circumstances.2. In cases in which partial payment of wages in the form of allowances in kind is authorised, appropriate measures shall be taken to ensure that such allowances are appropriate for the personal use and benefit of the worker and his family.3. Where food, housing, clothing and other essential supplies and services form part of remuneration, all practicable steps shall be taken to ensure that they are adequate and their cash value properly assessed.Article 28Wages shall be paid directly to the worker concerned except as may be otherwise provided by national laws or regulations, collective agreement or arbitration award or where the worker concerned has agreed to the contrary.Article 29Employers shall be prohibited from limiting in any manner the freedom of the worker to dispose of his wages.Article 301. Where works stores for the sale of commodities to the workers are established or services are operated in connection with an undertaking, the workers concerned shall be free from any coercion to make use of such stores or services.2. Where access to other stores or services is not possible, the competent authority shall take appropriate measures with the object of ensuring that goods are sold and services provided at fair and reasonable prices, or that stores established and services operated by the employer are not operated for the purpose of securing a profit but for the benefit of the workers concerned.Article 311. Deductions from wages shall be permitted only under conditions and to the extent prescribed by national laws or regulations or fixed by collective agreement or arbitration award.2. Workers shall be informed, in the manner deemed most appropriate by the competent authority, of the conditions under which and the extent to which such deductions may be made.Article 32Any deduction from wages with a view to ensuring a direct or indirect payment for the purpose of obtaining or retaining employment, made by a worker to an employer or his representative or to any intermediary (such as a labour contractor or recruiter), shall be prohibited.Article 331. Wages shall be paid regularly. Except where other appropriate arrangements exist which ensure the payment of wages at regular intervals, the intervals for the payment of wages shall be prescribed by national laws or regulations or fixed by collective agreement or arbitration award.2. Upon the termination of a contract of employment, a final settlement of all wages due shall be effected in accordance with national laws or regulations, collective agreement or arbitration award or, in the absence of any applicable law, regulation, agreement or award, within a reasonable period of time having regard to the terms of the contract.Article 34Where necessary, effective measures shall be taken to ensure that workers are informed, in an appropriate and easily understandable manner--(a) before they enter employment and when any changes take place, of the conditions in respect of wages under which they are employed; and(b) at the time of each payment of wages, of the particulars of their wages for the pay period concerned, in so far as such particulars may be subject to change.Article 35The laws or regulations giving effect to the provisions of Articles 26 to 34 of this Convention shall--(a) be made available for the information of persons concerned;(b) define the persons responsible for compliance therewith;(c) prescribe adequate penalties or other appropriate remedies for any violation thereof;(d) provide for the maintenance, in all appropriate cases, of adequate records in an approved form and manner.PART V. ANNUAL HOLIDAYS WITH PAYArticle 36Workers employed on plantations shall be granted an annual holiday with pay after a period of continuous service with the same employer.Article 371. Each Member for which this Part of this Convention is in force shall be free to decide the manner in which provision shall be made for holidays with pay on plantations.2. Such provision may be made, where appropriate, by means of collective agreement or by entrusting the regulation of holidays with pay on plantations to special bodies.3. Wherever the manner in which provision is made for holidays with pay on plantations permits--
			(a) there shall be full preliminary consultation with the most representative organisations of employers and workers concerned, where such exist, and with any other persons, specially qualified by their trade or functions, whom the competent authority deems it useful to consult;(b) the employers and workers concerned shall participate in the regulation of holidays with pay, or be consulted or have the right to be heard, in such manner and to such extent as may be determined by national laws or regulations, but in any case on a basis of complete equality.Article 38The required minimum period of continuous service and the minimum duration of the annual holiday with pay shall be determined by national laws or regulations, collective agreement or arbitration award, or by special bodies entrusted with the regulation of holidays with pay on plantations, or in any other manner approved by the competent authority.Article 39Where appropriate, provision shall be made, in accordance with the established procedure for the regulation of holidays with pay on plantations, for--(a) more favourable treatment for young workers, in cases in which the annual holiday with pay granted to adult workers is not considered adequate for young workers;(b) an increase in the duration of the annual paid holiday with the length of service;(c) proportionate holidays or payment in lieu thereof, in cases where the period of continuous service of a worker is not of sufficient duration to qualify him for an annual holiday with pay but exceeds such minimum period as may be determined in accordance with the established procedure;(d) the exclusion from the annual holiday with pay of public and customary holidays and weekly rest periods, and, to such extent as may be determined in accordance with the established procedure, temporary interruptions of attendance at work due to such causes as sickness or accident.Article 401. Every person taking a holiday in virtue of this Part of this Convention shall receive, in respect of the full period of the holiday, not less than his usual remuneration, or such remuneration as may be prescribed in accordance with paragraphs 2 and 3 of this Article.2. The remuneration payable in respect of the holiday shall be calculated as prescribed by national laws or regulations, collective agreement or arbitration award, or by special bodies entrusted with the regulation of holidays with pay on plantations, or in any other manner approved by the competent authority.3. Where the remuneration of the person taking a holiday includes payments in kind, provision may be made for the payment in respect of holidays of the cash equivalent of such payments in kind.Article 41Any agreement to relinquish the right to an annual holiday with pay, or to forgo such a holiday, shall be void.Article 42A person who is dismissed or who has relinquished his employment before he has taken the whole or any part of the holiday due to him shall receive in respect of every day of holiday due to him in virtue of this Part of this Convention the remuneration provided for in Article 40.PART VI. WEEKLY RESTArticle 431. Plantation workers shall, except as otherwise provided for by the following Articles, enjoy in every period of seven days a period of rest comprising at least 24 consecutive hours.2. This period of rest shall, wherever possible, be granted simultaneously to all the workers of each plantation.3. It shall, wherever possible, be fixed so as to coincide with the days already established by the traditions or customs of the country or district.Article 441. Each Member may authorise total or partial exceptions (including suspensions or diminutions) from the provisions of Article 43, special regard being had to all proper humanitarian and economic considerations and after consultation with responsible associations of employers and workers, wherever such exist.2. Such consultation shall not be necessary in the case of exceptions which have already been made under existing legislation.Article 45Each Member shall make, as far as possible, provision for compensatory periods of rest for the suspensions or diminutions made in virtue of Article 44, except in cases where agreements or customs already provide for such periods.PART VII. MATERNITY PROTECTIONArticle 46For the purpose of this Part of this Convention, the term woman means any female person, irrespective of age, nationality, race or creed whether married or unmarried, and the term child means any child whether born of marriage or not.Article 471. A woman to whom this Part of this Convention applies shall, on the production of appropriate evidence of the presumed date of her confinement, be entitled to a period of maternity leave.2. The competent authority may, after consultation with the most representative organisations of employers and workers, where such exist, prescribe a qualifying period for maternity leave which shall not exceed a total of 150 days of employment with the same employer during the 12 months preceding the confinement.3. The period of maternity leave shall be at least 12 weeks, and shall include a period of compulsory leave after confinement.4. The period of compulsory leave after confinement shall be prescribed by national laws or regulations, but shall in no case be less than six weeks; the remainder of the total period of maternity leave may be provided before the presumed date of confinement or following expiration of the compulsory leave period or partly before the presumed date of confinement and partly following the expiration of the compulsory leave period as may be prescribed by national laws or regulations.5. The leave before the presumed date of confinement shall be extended by any period elapsing between the presumed date of confinement and the actual date of confinement, and the period of compulsory leave to be taken after confinement shall not be reduced on that account.6. In case of illness suitably certified as arising out of pregnancy national laws or regulations shall provide for additional leave before confinement, the maximum duration of which may be fixed by the competent authority.7. In case of illness suitably certified as arising out of confinement the woman shall be entitled to an extension of the leave after confinement, the maximum duration of which may be fixed by the competent authority.8. No pregnant woman shall be required to undertake any type of work harmful to her in the period prior to her maternity leave.Article 481. While absent from work on maternity leave in accordance with the provisions of Article 47, the woman shall be entitled to receive cash and medical benefits.2. The rates of cash benefit shall be fixed by national laws or regulations so as to ensure benefits sufficient for the full and healthy maintenance of herself and her child in accordance with a suitable standard of living.3. Medical benefits shall include prenatal, confinement and postnatal care by qualified midwives or medical practitioners as well as hospitalisation care where necessary: freedom of choice of doctor and freedom of choice between a public and private hospital shall be respected as far as practicable.4. Any contribution due under a compulsory social insurance scheme providing maternity benefits and any tax based upon payrolls which is raised for the purpose of providing such benefits shall, whether paid both by the employer and the employees or by the employer, be paid in respect of the total number of men and women employed by the undertakings concerned, without distinction of sex.Article 491. If a woman is nursing her child she shall be entitled to interrupt her work for this purpose, under conditions to be prescribed by national laws or regulations.2. Interruptions of work for the purpose of nursing are to be counted as working hours and remunerated accordingly in cases in which the matter is governed by or in accordance with laws and regulations; in cases in which the matter is governed by collective agreement, the position shall be as determined by the relevant agreement.Article 501. While a woman is absent from work on maternity leave in accordance with the provisions of Article 47, it shall not be lawful for her employer to give her notice of dismissal during such absence, or to give her notice of dismissal at such time that the notice would expire during such absence.2. The dismissal of a woman solely because she is pregnant or a nursing mother shall be prohibited.PART VIII. WORKMEN'S COMPENSATIONArticle 51Each Member of the International Labour Organisation for which this Part of this Convention is in force undertakes to extend to all plantation workers its laws and regulations which provide for the compensation of workers for personal injury by accident arising out of or in the course of their employment.Article 521. Each Member for which this Part of this Convention is in force undertakes to grant to the nationals of any other Member for which this Part of this Convention is in force, who suffer personal injury due to industrial accidents happening in its territory, or to their dependants, the same treatment in respect of workmen's compensation as it grants to its own nationals.2. This equality of treatment shall be guaranteed to foreign workers and their dependants without any condition as to residence. With regard to the payments which a Member or its nationals would have to make outside that Member's territory in the application of this principle, the measures to be adopted shall be regulated, if necessary, by special arrangements between the Members concerned.Article 53Special agreements may be made between the Members concerned to provide that compensation for industrial accidents happening to workers whilst temporarily or intermittently employed in the territory of one Member on behalf of an undertaking situated in the territory of another Member shall be governed by the laws and regulations of the latter Member.PART IX. RIGHT TO ORGANISE AND COLLECTIVE BARGAININGArticle 54The right of employers and employed alike to associate for all lawful purposes shall be guaranteed by appropriate measures.Article 55All procedures for the investigation of disputes between employers and workers shall be as simple and expeditious as possible.Article 561. Employers and workers shall be encouraged to avoid disputes and, if they arise, to reach fair settlements by means of conciliation.2. For this purpose all practicable measures shall be taken to consult and associate the representatives of organisations of employers and workers in the establishment and working of conciliation machinery.3. Subject to the operation of such machinery, public officers shall be responsible for the investigation of disputes and shall endeavour to promote conciliation and to assist the parties in arriving at a fair settlement.4. Where practicable, these officers shall be officers specially assigned to such duties.Article 571. Machinery shall be created as rapidly as possible for the settlement of disputes between employers and workers.2. Representatives of the employers and workers concerned, including representatives of their respective organisations, where such exist, shall be associated where practicable in the operation of the machinery, in such manner and to such extent, but in any case in equal numbers and on equal terms, as may be determined by the competent authority.Article 581. Workers shall enjoy adequate protection against acts of anti-union discrimination in respect of their employment.2. Such protection shall apply more particularly in respect of acts calculated to--
			(a) make the employment of a worker subject to the condition that he shall not join a union or shall relinquish trade union membership;(b) cause the dismissal of or otherwise prejudice a worker by reason of union membership or because of participation in union activities outside working hours or, with the consent of the employer, within working hours.Article 591. Workers' and employers' organisations shall enjoy adequate protection against any acts of interference by each other or each other's agents or members in their establishment, functioning or administration.2.

			Preamble
		The General Conference of the International Labour Organisation,Having been convened at Geneva by the Governing Body of the International Labour Office, and having met in its Sixtieth Session on 4 June 1975, andRecognising that the importance of rural workers in the world makes it urgent to associate them with economic and social development action if their conditions of work and life are to be permanently and effectively improved, andNoting that in many countries of the world and particularly in developing countries there is massive under-utilisation of land and labour and that this makes it imperative for rural workers to be given every encouragement to develop free and viable organisations capable of protecting and furthering the interests of their members and ensuring their effective contribution to economic and social development, andConsidering that such organisations can and should contribute to the alleviation of the persistent scarcity of food products in various regions of the world, andRecognising that land reform is in many developing countries an essential factor in the improvement of the conditions of work and life of rural workers and that organisations of such workers should accordingly co-operate and participate actively in the implementation of such reform, andRecalling the terms of existing international labour Conventions and Recommendations--in particular the Right of Association (Agriculture) Convention, 1921, the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention, 1948, and the Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention, 1949--which affirm the right of all workers, including rural workers, to establish free and independent organisations, and the provisions of numerous international labour Conventions and Recommendations applicable to rural workers which call for the participation, inter alia, of workers' organisations in their implementation, andNoting the joint concern of the United Nations and the specialised agencies, in particular the International Labour Organisation and the Food and Agriculture Organisation of the United Nations, with land reform and rural development, andNoting that the following standards have been framed in co-operation with the Food and Agriculture Organisation of the United Nations and that, with a view to avoiding duplication, there will be continuing co-operation with that Organisation and with the United Nations in promoting and securing the application of these standards, andHaving decided upon the adoption of certain proposals with regard to organisations of rural workers and their role in economic and social development, which is the fourth item on the agenda of the session, andHaving determined that these proposals shall take the form of an international Convention,adopts this twenty-third day of June of the year one thousand nine hundred and seventy-five the following Convention, which may be cited as the Rural Workers' Organisations Convention, 1975:Article 1This Convention applies to all types of organisations of rural workers, including organisations not restricted to but representative of rural workers.Article 21.

This Convention applies only to those tenants, sharecroppers or small owner-occupiers who derive their main income from agriculture, who work the land themselves, with the help only of their family or with the help of occasional outside labour and who do not--
			(a) permanently employ workers; or(b) employ a substantial number of seasonal workers; or(c) have any land cultivated by sharecroppers or tenants.Article 31.

The principles of freedom of association shall be fully respected; rural workers' organisations shall be independent and voluntary in character and shall remain free from all interference, coercion or repression.3. The acquisition of legal personality by organisations of rural workers shall not be made subject to conditions of such a character as to restrict the application of the provisions of the preceding paragraphs of this Article.4. In exercising the rights provided for in this Article rural workers and their respective organisations, like other persons or organised collectivities, shall respect the law of the land.5. The law of the land shall not be such as to impair, nor shall it be so applied as to impair, the guarantees provided for in this Article.Article 4It shall be an objective of national policy concerning rural development to facilitate the establishment and growth, on a voluntary basis, of strong and independent organisations of rural workers as an effective means of ensuring the participation of rural workers, without discrimination as defined in the Discrimination (Employment and Occupation) Convention, 1958, in economic and social development and in the benefits resulting therefrom.Article 51. In order to enable organisations of rural workers to play their role in economic and social development, each Member which ratifies this Convention shall adopt and carry out a policy of active encouragement to these organisations, particularly with a view to eliminating obstacles to their establishment, their growth and the pursuit of their lawful activities, as well as such legislative and administrative discrimination against rural workers' organisations and their members as may exist.2. Each Member which ratifies this Convention shall ensure that national laws or regulations do not, given the special circumstances of the rural sector, inhibit the establishment and growth of rural workers' organisations.Article 6Steps shall be taken to promote the widest possible understanding of the need to further the development of rural workers' organisations and of the contribution they can make to improving employment opportunities and general conditions of work and life in rural areas as well as to increasing the national income and achieving a better distribution thereof.Article 7The formal ratifications of this Convention shall be communicated to the Director-General of the International Labour Office for registration.Article 81.

When notifying the Members of the Organisation of the registration of the second ratification communicated to him, the Director-General shall draw the attention of the Members of the Organisation to the date upon which the Convention will come into force.Article 11The Director-General of the International Labour Office shall communicate to the Secretary-General of the United Nations for registration in accordance with Article 102 of the Charter of the United Nations full particulars of all ratifications and acts of denunciation registered by him in accordance with the provisions of the preceding Articles.Article 12At such times as it may consider necessary the Governing Body of the International Labour Office shall present to the General Conference a report on the working of this Convention and shall examine the desirability of placing on the agenda of the Conference the question of its revision in whole or in part.Article 131.

			Preamble
		The General Conference of the International Labour Organisation,Having been convened at Geneva by the Governing Body of the International Labour Office, and having met in its Sixtieth Session on 4 June 1975, andConsidering that the Preamble of the Constitution of the International Labour Organisation assigns to it the task of protecting ""the interests of workers when employed in countries other than their own"", andConsidering that the Declaration of Philadelphia reaffirms, among the principles on which the Organisation is based, that ""labour is not a commodity"", and that ""poverty anywhere constitutes a danger to prosperity everywhere"", and recognises the solemn obligation of the ILO to further programmes which will achieve in particular full employment through ""the transfer of labour, including for employment ..."",Considering the ILO World Employment Programme and the Employment Policy Convention and Recommendation, 1964, and emphasising the need to avoid the excessive and uncontrolled or unassisted increase of migratory movements because of their negative social and human consequences, andConsidering that in order to overcome underdevelopment and structural and chronic unemployment, the governments of many countries increasingly stress the desirability of encouraging the transfer of capital and technology rather than the transfer of workers in accordance with the needs and requests of these countries in the reciprocal interest of the countries of origin and the countries of employment, andConsidering the right of everyone to leave any country, including his own, and to enter his own country, as set forth in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, andRecalling the provisions contained in the Migration for Employment Convention and Recommendation (Revised), 1949, in the Protection of Migrant Workers (Underdeveloped Countries) Recommendation, 1955, in the Employment Policy Convention and Recommendation, 1964, in the Employment Service Convention and Recommendation, 1948, and in the Fee-Charging Employment Agencies Convention (Revised), 1949, which deal with such matters as the regulation of the recruitment, introduction and placing of migrant workers, the provision of accurate information relating to migration, the minimum conditions to be enjoyed by migrants in transit and on arrival, the adoption of an active employment policy and international collaboration in these matters, andConsidering that the migration of workers due to conditions in labour markets should take place under the responsibility of official agencies for employment or in accordance with the relevant bilateral or multilateral agreements, in particular those permitting free circulation of workers, andConsidering that evidence of the existence of illicit and clandestine trafficking in labour calls for further standards specifically aimed at eliminating these abuses, andRecalling the provisions of the Migration for Employment Convention (Revised), 1949, which require ratifying Members to apply to immigrants lawfully within their territory treatment not less favourable than that which they apply to their nationals in respect of a variety of matters which it enumerates, in so far as these are regulated by laws or regulations or subject to the control of administrative authorities, andRecalling that the definition of the term ""discrimination"" in the Discrimination (Employment and Occupation) Convention, 1958, does not mandatorily include distinctions on the basis of nationality, andConsidering that further standards, covering also social security, are desirable in order to promote equality of opportunity and treatment of migrant workers and, with regard to matters regulated by laws or regulations or subject to the control of administrative authorities, ensure treatment at least equal to that of nationals, andNoting that, for the full success of action regarding the very varied problems of migrant workers, it is essential that there be close co-operation with the United Nations and other specialised agencies, andNoting that, in the framing of the following standards, account has been taken of the work of the United Nations and of other specialised agencies and that, with a view to avoiding duplication and to ensuring appropriate co-ordination, there will be continuing co-operation in promoting and securing the application of the standards, andHaving decided upon the adoption of certain proposals with regard to migrant workers, which is the fifth item on the agenda of the session, andHaving determined that these proposals shall take the form of an international Convention supplementing the Migration for Employment Convention (Revised), 1949, and the Discrimination (Employment and Occupation) Convention, 1958,adopts this twenty-fourth day of June of the year one thousand nine hundred and seventy-five the following Convention, which may be cited as the Migrant Workers (Supplementary Provisions) Convention, 1975:PART I. MIGRATIONS IN ABUSIVE CONDITIONSArticle 1Each Member for which this Convention is in force undertakes to respect the basic human rights of all migrant workers.Article 21. Each Member for which this Convention is in force shall systematically seek to determine whether there are illegally employed migrant workers on its territory and whether there depart from, pass through or arrive in its territory any movements of migrants for employment in which the migrants are subjected during their journey, on arrival or during their period of residence and employment to conditions contravening relevant international multilateral or bilateral instruments or agreements, or national laws or regulations.2. The representative organisations of employers and workers shall be fully consulted and enabled to furnish any information in their possession on this subject.Article 3Each Member shall adopt all necessary and appropriate measures, both within its jurisdiction and in collaboration with other Members--(a) to suppress clandestine movements of migrants for employment and illegal employment of migrants, and(b) against the organisers of illicit or clandestine movements of migrants for employment departing from, passing through or arriving in its territory, and against those who employ workers who have immigrated in illegal conditions,in order to prevent and to eliminate the abuses referred to in Article 2 of this Convention.Article 4In particular, Members shall take such measures as are necessary, at the national and the international level, for systematic contact and exchange of information on the subject with other States, in consultation with representative organisations of employers and workers.Article 5One of the purposes of the measures taken under Articles 3 and 4 of this Convention shall be that the authors of manpower trafficking can be prosecuted whatever the country from which they exercise their activities.Article 61.

On condition that he has resided legally in the territory for the purpose of employment, the migrant worker shall not be regarded as in an illegal or irregular situation by the mere fact of the loss of his employment, which shall not in itself imply the withdrawal of his authorisation of residence or, as the case may be, work permit.2. Accordingly, he shall enjoy equality of treatment with nationals in respect in particular of guarantees of security of employment, the provision of alternative employment, relief work and retraining.Article 91. Without prejudice to measures designed to control movements of migrants for employment by ensuring that migrant workers enter national territory and are admitted to employment in conformity with the relevant laws and regulations, the migrant worker shall, in cases in which these laws and regulations have not been respected and in which his position cannot be regularised, enjoy equality of treatment for himself and his family in respect of rights arising out of past employment as regards remuneration, social security and other benefits.2. In case of dispute about the rights referred to in the preceding paragraph, the worker shall have the possibility of presenting his case to a competent body, either himself or through a representative.3. In case of expulsion of the worker or his family, the cost shall not be borne by them.4.

A Member may take all necessary measures which fall within its competence and collaborate with other Members to facilitate the reunification of the families of all migrant workers legally residing in its territory.2. The members of the family of the migrant worker to which this Article applies are the spouse and dependent children, father and mother.Article 14A Member may--(a) make the free choice of employment, while assuring migrant workers the right to geographical mobility, subject to the conditions that the migrant worker has resided lawfully in its territory for the purpose of employment for a prescribed period not exceeding two years or, if its laws or regulations provide for contracts for a fixed term of less than two years, that the worker has completed his first work contract;(b) after appropriate consultation with the representative organisations of employers and workers, make regulations concerning recognition of occupational qualifications acquired outside its territory, including certificates and diplomas;(c) restrict access to limited categories of employment or functions where this is necessary in the interests of the State.PART III FINAL PROVISIONSArticle 15This Convention does not prevent Members from concluding multilateral or bilateral agreements with a view to resolving problems arising from its application.Article 161.

LEGAL AND ADMINISTRATIVE SAFEGUARDSArticle 30Every person concerned shall have a right of appeal in case of refusal of the benefit or complaint as to its nature, level, amount or quality.Article 31Where a government department responsible to a legislature is entrusted with the administration of medical care, every person concerned shall have a right, in addition to the right of appeal provided for in Article 30, to have a complaint concerning the refusal of medical care or the quality of the care received investigated by the appropriate authority.Article 32Each Member shall make provision for securing the rapid and inexpensive settlement of disputes concerning the shipowner's liability provided for in Articles 13 to 15.Article 33Members shall accept general responsibility for the due provision of the benefits provided in compliance with this Convention and shall take all measures required for this purpose.Article 34Members shall accept general responsibility for the proper administration of the institutions and services concerned in the application of this Convention.Article 35Where the administration is not entrusted to an institution regulated by the public authorities or to a government department responsible to a legislature-(a) representatives of the seafarers protected shall participate in the management under conditions prescribed by national legislation;(b) national legislation shall also, where appropriate, provide for the participation of representatives of the shipowners;(c) national legislation may also provide for the participation of representatives of the public authorities.PART VI.
