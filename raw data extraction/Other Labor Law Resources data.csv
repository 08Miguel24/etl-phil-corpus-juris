Migrant Workers and Overseas Filipinos Act of 1995
 

AN ACT TO INSTITUTE THE POLICIES OF OVERSEAS EMPLOYMENT AND ESTABLISH A HIGHER STANDARD OF PROTECTION AND PROMOTION OF THE WELFARE OF MIGRANT WORKERS, THEIR FAMILIES AND OVERSEAS FILIPINOS IN DISTRESS,
AND FOR OTHER PURPOSES.
 
Section 1. Short Title. - This Act shall be known and cited as the ""Migrant Workers and Overseas Filipinos Act of 1995"". 
Sec. 2. Declaration of Policies.
(a)  In the pursuit of an independent foreign policy and while considering national sovereignty, territorial integrity, national interest and the right to self- determination paramount in its relations with other states, the State shall, at all times, uphold the dignity of its citizens whether in country or overseas, in general, and Filipino migrant workers, in particular.
 
(b) The State shall afford full protection to labor, local and overseas, organized and unorganized, and promote full employment and equality of employment opportunities for all. Towards this end, the State shall provide adequate and timely social, economic and legal services to Filipino migrant workers.
 
(c) While recognizing the significant contribution of Filipino migrant workers to the national economy through their foreign exchange remittances, the State does not promote overseas employment as a means to sustain economic growth an achieve national development. The existence of the overseas employment program rests solely on the assurance that the dignity and fundamental human rights and freedoms of the Filipino citizen shall not, at any time, be compromised or violated. The State, therefore, shall continuously create local employment opportunities and promote the equitable distribution of wealth and the benefits of development.
 
(d) The State affirms the fundamental equality before the law of women and men and the significant role of women in nation-building. Recognizing the contribution of overseas migrant women workers and their particular vulnerabilities, the State shall apply gender sensitive criteria in the formulation and implementation of policies and programs affecting migrant workers and the composition of bodies tasked for the welfare of migrant workers.
 
(e) Free access to the courts and quasi-judicial bodies and adequate legal assistance shall not be denied to any person by reason of poverty. In this regard, it is imperative that an effective mechanism be instituted to ensure that the rights and interest of distressed overseas Filipinos, in general, and Filipino migrant workers, in particular, documented or undocumented, are adequately protected and safeguarded.
 
(f) The right of Filipino migrant workers and all overseas Filipinos to participate in the democratic decision-making processes of the State and to be represented in institutions relevant to overseas employment is recognized and guaranteed.
 
(g) The State recognizes that the ultimate protection to all migrant workers is the possession of skills. Pursuant to this and as soon as practicable, the government shall deploy and/or allow the deployment only of skilled Filipino workers.
 
(h) Non-governmental organizations, duly recognized as legitimate, are partners of the State in the protection of Filipino migrant workers and in the promotion of their welfare. The State shall cooperate with them in a spirit of trust and mutual respect.
 
(i) Government fees and other administrative costs of recruitment, introduction, placement and assistance to migrant workers shall be rendered free without prejudice to the provision of Sec. 36 hereof.
Nonetheless, the deployment of Filipino overseas workers, whether land- based or sea-based, by local service contractors and manning agencies employing them shall be encouraged. Appropriate incentives may be extended to them.

Series of 2002
  

TO     :      All Accredited Agencies/Entities Providing Pre-Departure Orientation Seminar (PDOS) for Overseas 
         Filipino Workers
SUBJECT     :     HIV/AIDS Education in the PDOS

There is an increasing recognition that migrants and mobile populations are more vulnerable to HIV/AIDS than populations that do not move.  Given the fact that millions of overseas Filipino workers (OFWs) compose the greater bulk of Filipino migrant workers, the government recognizes an urgent need to systematically implement an HIV/AIDS prevention and control program.

In coordination with other concerned authorities in both the national and international levels, the Philippine Overseas Employment Administration (POEA)  has thus adopted a preventive strategy by integrating an HIV/AIDS Education component in its mandatory Pre Departure Orientation Seminar (PDOS) and other information/education programs for OFWs.

All accredited PDOS providers are therefore directed to integrate the HIV/AIDS module for OFWs in their PDOS.  All accredited trainors who have not attended training on the new module shall coordinate with the Workers Education Division, Welfare and Employment Office for scheduling.

This Memorandum Circular takes effect immediately.

For compliance.

SUBJECT  :    Implementation of the E-Receipt System for Overseas Land-Based Workers
                  Hired Through Recruitment Agencies

Pursuant to the thrust of the Administration to streamline processes and requirements for the documentary processing of overseas Filipino workers, the e-Receipt system shall be implemented for workers documented at the POEA Central Office.

The e-Receipt system envisions to facilitate the processing of worker documents and their mobilization through electronic connectivity. The e-Receipt which takes the place of the overseas employment certificate (OEC),  indicates the name of the worker, recruitment agency and worksite, and the processing date and validity.  The Official Receipt Number/Serial Number shall replace the OEC number. The three copies of the e-Receipt are for the worker, airline and airport.

The e-Receipt system is now being pilot tested with the view of achieving efficiency. The use of OECs shall be an option if technical problems will occur. Corrections on the entry(ies) in the e-Receipt will be countersigned by the overseas labor officers authorized for this purpose.

For  information.

SUBJECT     :      Adoption of E-Receipt System for the Processing of Employment Contracts for Seafarers

by TESDA. The TESDA shall facilitate the issuance of testimonial ARB to
such artists, without prejudice to verification and/or submission of

folio
and the like if necessary under the circumstances.

center must subscribe to TESDA regulations on training centers.
