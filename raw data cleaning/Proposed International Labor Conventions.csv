Where the rate of benefit varies by region, the skilled manual male employee may be determined for each region in accordance with paragraphs 6 and 7 of this Article.9. The wage of the skilled manual male employee shall be determined on the basis of the rates of wages for normal hours of work fixed by collective agreements, by or in pursuance of national laws or regulations, where applicable, or by custom, including cost-of-living allowances if any; where such rates differ by region but paragraph 8 of this Article is not applied, the median rate shall be taken.10.

Where the rate of benefit varies by region, the ordinary adult male labourer may be determined for each region in accordance with paragraphs 4 and 5 of this Article.7. The wage of the ordinary adult male labourer shall be determined on the basis of the rates of wages for normal hours of work fixed by collective agreements, by or in pursuance of national laws or regulations, where applicable, or by custom, including cost-of-living allowances if any; where such rates differ by region but paragraph 6 of this Article is not applied, the median rate shall be taken.8. The rates of current periodical payments in respect of old age, employment injury (except in case of incapacity for work), invalidity and death of breadwinner, shall be reviewed following substantial changes in the general level of earnings where these result from substantial changes in the cost of living.Article 67In the case of a periodical payment to which this Article applies--(a) the rate of the benefit shall be determined according to a prescribed scale or a scale fixed by the competent public authority in conformity with prescribed rules;(b) such rate may be reduced only to the extent by which the other means of the family of the beneficiary exceed prescribed substantial amounts or substantial amounts fixed by the competent public authority in conformity with prescribed rules;(c) the total of the benefit and any other means, after deduction of the substantial amounts referred to in subparagraph (b), shall be sufficient to maintain the family of the beneficiary in health and decency, and shall be not less than the corresponding benefit calculated in accordance with the requirements of Article 66;(d) the provisions of subparagraph (c) shall be deemed to be satisfied if the total amount of benefits paid under the Part concerned exceeds by at least 30 per cent. the total amount of benefits which would be obtained by applying the provisions of Article 66 and the provisions of: (i) Article 15 (b) for Part III;(ii) Article 27 (b) for Part V;(iii) Article 55 (b) for Part IX;(iv) Article 61 (b) for Part X.PartContingencyStandard BeneficiaryPercentageIIISicknessMan with wife and two children45 IV Unemployment Man with wife and two children 45VOld ageMan with wife of pensionable age40VIEmployment injury:Incapacity of workMan with wife and two children50InvalidityMan with wife and two children50SurvivorsWidow with two children40VIIIMaternityWoman45IXInvalidity Man with wife and two children40XSurvivorsWidow with two children40PART XII.

Every claimant shall have a right of appeal in case of refusal of the benefit or complaint as to its quality or quantity.2. Where in the application of this Convention a Government department responsible to a legislature is entrusted with the administration of medical care, the right of appeal provided for in paragraph 1 of this Article may be replaced by a right to have a complaint concerning the refusal of medical care or the quality of the care received investigated by the appropriate authority.3.

The degrees of loss of earning capacity or corresponding loss of faculty referred to in paragraphs 1 and 3 of this Article shall be prescribed in such manner as to avoid hardship.Article 151. In exceptional circumstances, and with the agreement of the injured person, all or part of the periodical payment provided for in paragraphs 2 and 3 of Article 14 may be converted into a lump sum corresponding to the actuarial equivalent thereof when the competent authority has reason to believe that such lump sum will be utilised in a manner which is particularly advantageous for the injured person.2. Where a declaration provided for in Article 2 is in force and the Member concerned considers that it lacks the necessary administrative facilities for periodical payments, the periodical payment provided for in paragraphs 2 and 3 of Article 14 may be converted into a lump sum corresponding to the actuarial equivalent thereof, as computed on the basis of available data.Article 16Increments in periodical payments or other supplementary or special benefits, as prescribed, shall be provided for disabled persons requiring the constant help or attendance of another person.Article 17The conditions in which periodical payments due in respect of loss of earning capacity or corresponding loss of faculty shall be reassessed, suspended or cancelled by reference to a change in the degree of loss shall be prescribed.Article 181.

In the case of a periodical payment to which this Article applies, the rate of the benefit, increased by the amount of any family allowances payable during the contingency, shall be such as to attain, in respect of the contingency in question, for the standard beneficiary indicated in Schedule II to this Convention, at least the percentage indicated therein of the total of the previous earnings of the beneficiary or his breadwinner and of the amount of any family allowances payable to a person protected with the same family responsibilities as the standard beneficiary.2. The previous earnings of the beneficiary or his breadwinner shall be calculated according to prescribed rules, and, where the persons protected or their breadwinners are arranged in classes according to their earnings, their previous earnings may be calculated from the basic earnings of the classes to which they belonged.3. A maximum limit may be prescribed for the rate of the benefit or for the earnings taken into account for the calculation of the benefit, provided that the maximum limit is fixed in such a way that the provisions of paragraph 1 of this Article are complied with where the previous earnings of the beneficiary or his breadwinner are equal to or lower than the wage of a skilled manual male employee.4. The previous earnings of the beneficiary or his breadwinner, the wage of the skilled manual male employee, the benefit and any family allowances shall be calculated on the same time basis.5.

Where the rate of benefit varies by region, the skilled manual male employee may be determined for each region in accordance with paragraphs 6 and 7 of this Article.9. The wage of the skilled manual male employee shall be determined on the basis of the rates of wages for normal hours of work fixed by collective agreements, by or in pursuance of national laws or regulations, where applicable, or by custom, including cost-of-living allowances, if any; where such rates differ by region but paragraph 8 of this Article is not applied, the median rate shall be taken.10. No periodical payment shall be less than a prescribed minimum amount.Article 201. In the case of a periodical payment to which this Article applies, the rate of the benefit, increased by the amount of any family allowances payable during the contingency, shall be such as to attain, in respect of the contingency in question, for the standard beneficiary indicated in Schedule II to this Convention, at least the percentage indicated therein of the total of the wage of an ordinary adult male labourer and of the amount of any family allowances payable to a person protected with the same family responsibilities as the standard beneficiary.2. The wage of the ordinary adult male labourer, the benefit and any family allowances shall be calculated on the same time basis.3.

For the purpose of this Article, the ordinary adult male labourer shall be-- (a) a person deemed typical of unskilled labour in the manufacture of machinery other than electrical machinery; or(b) a person deemed typical of unskilled labour selected in accordance with the provisions of the following paragraph.5. The person deemed typical of unskilled labour for the purpose of clause (b) of the preceding paragraph shall be a person employed in the major group of economic activities with the largest number of economically active male persons protected in the contingency in question, or of the breadwinners of the persons protected, as the case may be, in the division comprising the largest number of such persons or breadwinners; for this purpose the international standard industrial classification of all economic activities, adopted by the Economic and Social Council of the United Nations at its Seventh Session on 27 August 1948, as amended and reproduced in the Annex to this Convention, or such classification as at any time further amended, shall be used.6. Where the rate of benefit varies by region, the ordinary adult male labourer may be determined for each region in accordance with paragraphs 4 and 5 of this Article.7. The wage of the ordinary adult male labourer shall be determined on the basis of the rates of wages for normal hours of work fixed by collective agreements, by or in pursuance of national laws or regulations, where applicable, or by custom, including cost-of-living allowances if any; where such rates differ by region but paragraph 6 of this Article is not applied, the median rate shall be taken.8. No periodical payment shall be less than a prescribed minimum amount.Article 211. The rates of cash benefits currently payable pursuant to paragraphs 2 and 3 of Article 14 and paragraph 1 of Article 18 shall be reviewed following substantial changes in the general level of earnings where these result from substantial changes in the cost of living.2.

A benefit to which a person protected would otherwise be entitled in compliance with this Convention may be suspended to such extent as may be prescribed-- (a) as long as the person concerned is absent from the territory of the Member;(b) as long as the person concerned is maintained at public expense or at the expense of a social security institution or service;(c) where the person concerned has made a fraudulent claim;(d) where the employment injury has been caused by a criminal offence committed by the person concerned;(e) where the employment injury has been caused by voluntary intoxication or by the serious and wilful misconduct of the person concerned;(f) where the person concerned, without good cause, neglects to make use of the medical care and allied benefits or the rehabilitation services placed at his disposal, or fails to comply with rules prescribed for verifying the occurrence or continuance of the contingency or for the conduct of beneficiaries; and(g) as long as the surviving spouse is living with another person as spouse.2. In the cases and within the limits prescribed, part of the cash benefit otherwise due shall be paid to the dependants of the person concerned.Article 231. Every claimant shall have a right of appeal in the case of refusal of the benefit or complaint as to its quality or quantity.2. Where in the application of this Convention a government department responsible to a legislature is entrusted with the administration of medical care, the right of appeal provided for in paragraph 1 of this Article may be replaced by a right to have a complaint concerning the refusal of medical care or the quality of the care received investigated by the appropriate authority.3. Where a claim is settled by a special tribunal established to deal with employment injury benefit questions or with social security questions in general and on which the persons protected are represented, no right of appeal shall be required.Article 241. Where the administration is not entrusted to an institution regulated by the public authorities or to a government department responsible to a legislature, representatives of the persons protected shall participate in the management, or be associated therewith in a consultative capacity, under prescribed conditions; national legislation may likewise decide as to the participation of representatives of employers and of the public authorities.2.

For the purpose of this Convention, the term mine means any undertaking, whether public or private, for the extraction of any substance from under the surface of the earth by means involving the employment of persons underground.2. The provisions of this Convention concerning employment or work underground in mines include employment or work underground in quarries.Article 21.

In this Convention the term agricultural undertaking means undertakings and parts of undertakings engaged in cultivation, animal husbandry including livestock production and care, forestry, horticulture, the primary processing of agricultural products by the operator of the holding or any other form of agricultural activity.2. Where necessary, the competent authority shall, after consultation with the most representative organisations of employers and workers concerned, where such exist, define the line which separates agriculture from industry and commerce in such a manner as not to exclude any agricultural undertaking from the national system of labour inspection.3. In any case in which it is doubtful whether an undertaking or part of an undertaking is one to which this Convention applies, the question shall be settled by the competent authority.Article 2In this Convention the term legal provisions includes, in addition to laws and regulations, arbitration awards and collective agreements upon which the force of law is conferred and which are enforceable by labour inspectors.Article 3Each Member of the International Labour Organisation for which this Convention is in force shall maintain a system of labour inspection in agriculture.Article 4The system of labour inspection in agriculture shall apply to agricultural undertakings in which work employees or apprentices, however they may be remunerated and whatever the type, form or duration of their contract.Article 51. Any Member ratifying this Convention may, in a declaration accompanying its ratification, undertake also to cover by labour inspection in agriculture one or more of the following categories of persons working in agricultural undertakings: (a) tenants who do not engage outside help, sharecroppers and similar categories of agricultural workers;(b) persons participating in a collective economic enterprise, such as members of a co-operative;(c) members of the family of the operator of the undertaking, as defined by national laws or regulations.2. Any Member which has ratified this Convention may subsequently communicate to the Director-General of the International Labour Office a declaration undertaking to cover one or more of the categories of persons referred to in the preceding paragraph which are not already covered in virtue of a previous declaration.3. Each Member which has ratified this Convention shall indicate in its reports under article 22 of the Constitution of the International Labour Organisation to what extent effect has been given or is proposed to be given to the provisions of the Convention in respect of such of the categories of persons referred to in paragraph 1 of this Article as are not covered in virtue of a declaration.Article 61. The functions of the system of labour inspection in agriculture shall be-- (a) to secure the enforcement of the legal provisions relating to conditions of work and the protection of workers while engaged in their work, such as provisions relating to hours, wages, weekly rest and holidays, safety, health and welfare, the employment of women, children and young persons, and other connected matters, in so far as such provisions are enforceable by labour inspectors;(b) to supply technical information and advice to employers and workers concerning the most effective means of complying with the legal provisions;(c) to bring to the notice of the competent authority defects or abuses not specifically covered by existing legal provisions and to submit to it proposals on the improvement of laws and regulations.2. National laws or regulations may give labour inspectors in agriculture advisory or enforcement functions regarding legal provisions relating to conditions of life of workers and their families.3. Any further duties which may be entrusted to labour inspectors in agriculture shall not be such as to interfere with the effective discharge of their primary duties or to prejudice in any way the authority and impartiality which are necessary to inspectors in their relations with employers and workers.Article 71. So far as is compatible with the administrative practice of the Member, labour inspection in agriculture shall be placed under the supervision and control of a central body.2. In the case of a federal State, the term central body may mean either one at federal level or one at the level of a federated unit.3. Labour inspection in agriculture might be carried out for example-- (a) by a single labour inspection department responsible for all sectors of economic activity;(b) by a single labour inspection department, which would arrange for internal functional specialisation through the appropriate training of inspectors called upon to exercise their functions in agriculture;(c) by a single labour inspection department, which would arrange for internal institutional specialisation by creating a technically qualified service, the officers of which would perform their functions in agriculture; or(d) by a specialised agricultural inspection service, the activity of which would be supervised by a central body vested with the same prerogatives in respect of labour inspection in other fields, such as industry, transport and commerce.Article 81. The labour inspection staff in agriculture shall be composed of public officials whose status and conditions of service are such that they are assured of stability of employment and are independent of changes of government and of improper external influences.2. So far as is compatible with national laws or regulations or with national practice, Members may include in their system of labour inspection in agriculture officials or representatives of occupational organisations, whose activities would supplement those of the public inspection staff; the persons concerned shall be assured of stability of tenure and be independent of improper external influences.Article 91. Subject to any conditions for recruitment to the public service which may be prescribed by national laws or regulations, labour inspectors in agriculture shall be recruited with sole regard to their qualifications for the performance of their duties.2. The means of ascertaining such qualifications shall be determined by the competent authority.3. Labour inspectors in agriculture shall be adequately trained for the performance of their duties and measures shall be taken to give them appropriate further training in the course of their employment.Article 10Both men and women shall be eligible for appointment to the labour inspection staff in agriculture; where necessary, special duties may be assigned to men and women inspectors.Article 11Each Member shall take the necessary measures to ensure that duly qualified technical experts and specialists, who might help to solve problems demanding technical knowledge, are associated in the work of labour inspection in agriculture in such manner as may be deemed most appropriate under national conditions.Article 121. The competent authority shall make appropriate arrangements to promote effective co-operation between the inspection services in agriculture and government services and public or approved institutions which may be engaged in similar activities.2. Where necessary, the competent authority may either entrust certain inspection functions at the regional or local level on an auxiliary basis to appropriate government services or public institutions or associate these services or institutions with the exercise of the functions in question, on condition that this does not prejudice the application of the principles of this Convention.Article 13The competent authority shall make appropriate arrangements to promote collaboration between officials of the labour inspectorate in agriculture and employers and workers, or their organisations where such exist.Article 14Arrangements shall be made to ensure that the number of labour inspectors in agriculture is sufficient to secure the effective discharge of the duties of the inspectorate and is determined with due regard for--(a) the importance of the duties which inspectors have to perform, in particular-- (i) the number, nature, size and situation of the agricultural undertakings liable to inspection;(ii) the number and classes of persons working in such undertakings; and(iii) the number and complexity of the legal provisions to be enforced;(b) the material means placed at the disposal of the inspectors; and(c) the practical conditions under which visits of inspection must be carried out in order to be effective.Article 151. The competent authority shall make the necessary arrangements to furnish labour inspectors in agriculture with-- (a) local offices so located as to take account of the geographical situation of the agricultural undertakings and of the means of communication, suitably equipped in accordance with the requirements of the service, and, in so far as possible, accessible to the persons concerned;(b) the transport facilities necessary for the performance of their duties in cases where suitable public facilities do not exist.2. The competent authority shall make the necessary arrangements to reimburse to labour inspectors in agriculture any travelling and incidental expenses which may be necessary for the performance of their duties.Article 161. Labour inspectors in agriculture provided with proper credentials shall be empowered-- (a) to enter freely and without previous notice at any hour of the day or night any workplace liable to inspection;(b) to enter by day any premises which they may have reasonable cause to believe to be liable to inspection;(c) to carry out any examination, test or inquiry which they may consider necessary in order to satisfy themselves that the legal provisions are being strictly observed, and in particular-- (i) to interview, alone or in the presence of witnesses, the employer, the staff of the undertaking or any other person in the undertaking on any matters concerning the application of the legal provisions;(ii) to require, in such manner as national laws or regulations may prescribe, the production of any books, registers or other documents the keeping of which is prescribed by national laws or regulations relating to conditions of life and work, in order to see that they are in conformity with the legal provisions, and to copy such documents or make extracts from them;(iii) to take or remove for purposes of analysis samples of products, materials and substances used or handled, subject to the employer or his representative being notified of any products, materials or substances taken or removed for such purposes.2. Labour inspectors shall not enter the private home of the operator of the undertaking in pursuance of subparagraph (a) or (b) of paragraph 1 of this Article except with the consent of the operator or with a special authorisation issued by the competent authority.3. On the occasion of an inspection visit, inspectors shall notify the employer or his representative, and the workers or their representatives, of their presence, unless they consider that such a notification may be prejudicial to the performance of their duties.Article 17The labour inspection services in agriculture shall be associated, in such cases and in such manner as may be determined by the competent authority, in the preventive control of new plant, new materials or substances and new methods of handling or processing products which appear likely to constitute a threat to health or safety.Article 181. Labour inspectors in agriculture shall be empowered to take steps with a view to remedying defects observed in plant, layout or working methods in agricultural undertakings, including the use of dangerous materials or substances, which they may have reasonable cause to believe constitute a threat to health or safety.2. In order to enable inspectors to take such steps they shall be empowered, subject to any right of appeal to a legal or administrative authority which may be provided by law, to make or have made orders requiring-- (a) such alterations to the installation, plant, premises, tools, equipment or machines, to be carried out within a specified time limit, as may be necessary to secure compliance with the legal provisions relating to health or safety; or(b) measures with immediate executory force, which can go as far as halting the work, in the event of imminent danger to health or safety.3. Where the procedure described in paragraph 2 is not compatible with the administrative or judicial practice of the Member, inspectors shall have the right to apply to the competent authority for the issue of orders or for the initiation of measures with immediate executory force.4. The defects noted by the inspector when visiting an undertaking and the orders he is making or having made in pursuance of paragraph 2 or for which he intends to apply in pursuance of paragraph 3 shall be immediately made known to the employer and the representatives of the workers.Article 191. The labour inspectorate in agriculture shall be notified of occupational accidents and cases of occupational disease occurring in the agricultural sector in such cases and in such manner as may be prescribed by national laws or regulations.2. As far as possible, inspectors shall be associated with any inquiry on the spot into the causes of the most serious occupational accidents or occupational diseases, particularly of those which affect a number of workers or have fatal consequences.Article 20Subject to such exceptions as may be made by national laws or regulations, labour inspectors in agriculture--(a) shall be prohibited from having any direct or indirect interest in the undertakings under their supervision;(b) shall be bound on pain of appropriate penalties or disciplinary measures not to reveal, even after leaving the service, any manufacturing or commercial secrets or working processes which may come to their knowledge in the course of their duties; and(c) shall treat as absolutely confidential the source of any complaint bringing to their notice a defect, a danger in working processes or a breach of legal provisions and shall give no intimation to the employer or his representative that a visit of inspection was made in consequence of the receipt of such a complaint.Article 21Agricultural undertakings shall be inspected as often and as thoroughly as is necessary to ensure the effective application of the relevant legal provisions.Article 221. Persons who violate or neglect to observe legal provisions enforceable by labour inspectors in agriculture shall be liable to prompt legal or administrative proceedings without previous warning: Provided that exceptions may be made by national laws or regulations in respect of cases in which previous notice to carry out remedial or preventive measures is to be given.2. It shall be left to the discretion of labour inspectors to give warning and advice instead of instituting or recommending proceedings.Article 23If labour inspectors in agriculture are not themselves authorised to institute proceedings, they shall be empowered to refer reports of infringements of the legal provisions directly to an authority competent to institute such proceedings.Article 24Adequate penalties for violations of the legal provisions enforceable by labour inspectors in agriculture and for obstructing labour inspectors in the performance of their duties shall be provided for by national laws or regulations and effectively enforced.Article 251. Labour inspectors or local inspection offices, as the case may be, shall be required to submit to the central inspection authority periodical reports on the results of their activities in agriculture.2. These reports shall be drawn up in such manner and deal with such subjects as may from time to time be prescribed by the central inspection authority; they shall be submitted at least as frequently as may be prescribed by that authority and in any case not less frequently than once a year.Article 261. The central inspection authority shall publish an annual report on the work of the inspection services in agriculture, either as a separate report or as part of its general annual report.2. Such annual reports shall be published within a reasonable time after the end of the year to which they relate and in any case within twelve months.3. Copies of the annual reports shall be transmitted to the Director-General of the International Labour Office within three months after their publication.Article 27The annual report published by the central inspection authority shall deal in particular with the following subjects, in so far as they are under the control of the said authority:(a) laws and regulations relevant to the work of labour inspection in agriculture;(b) staff of the labour inspection service in agriculture;(c) statistics of agricultural undertakings liable to inspection and the number of persons working therein;(d) statistics of inspection visits;(e) statistics of violations and penalties imposed;(f) statistics of occupational accidents, including their causes;(g) statistics of occupational diseases, including their causes.Article 28The formal ratifications of this Convention shall be communicated to the Director-General of the International Labour Office for registration.Article 291. This Convention shall be binding only upon those Members of the International Labour Organisation whose ratifications have been registered with the Director-General.2. It shall come into force twelve months after the date on which the ratifications of two Members have been registered with the Director-General.3. Thereafter, this Convention shall come into force for any Member twelve months after the date on which its ratification has been registered.Article 301. A Member which has ratified this Convention may denounce it after the expiration of ten years from the date on which the Convention first comes into force, by an act communicated to the Director-General of the International Labour Office for registration. Such denunciation shall not take effect until one year after the date on which it is registered.2. Each Member which has ratified this Convention and which does not, within the year following the expiration of the period of ten years mentioned in the preceding paragraph, exercise the right of denunciation provided for in this Article, will be bound for another period of ten years and, thereafter, may denounce this Convention at the expiration of each period of ten years under the terms provided for in this Article.Article 311. The Director-General of the International Labour Office shall notify all Members of the International Labour Organisation of the registration of all ratifications and denunciations communicated to him by the Members of the Organisation.2. When notifying the Members of the Organisation of the registration of the second ratification communicated to him, the Director-General shall draw the attention of the Members of the Organisation to the date upon which the Convention will come into force.Article 32The Director-General of the International Labour Office shall communicate to the Secretary-General of the United Nations for registration in accordance with Article 102 of the Charter of the United Nations full particulars of all ratifications and acts of denunciation registered by him in accordance with the provisions of the preceding Articles.Article 33At such times as it may consider necessary the Governing Body of the International Labour Office shall present to the General Conference a report on the working of this Convention and shall examine the desirability of placing on the agenda of the Conference the question of its revision in whole or in part.Article 341.

National laws or regulations shall determine, after consultation with the organisations of shipowners and seafarers concerned, where such exist, which ships are to be regarded as sea-going ships for the purpose of this Convention.4. Each Member which ratifies this Convention may, after consultation with the organisations of employers and workers concerned, where such exist, extend its application, with the modifications rendered necessary by the conditions of the industry, to the persons excluded from the definition of seafarers by paragraph 2, subparagraph (b), of this Article, or to certain categories thereof.5. Each Member which extends the application of this Convention in pursuance of paragraph 4 of this Article at the time of ratifying it shall specify in a declaration appended to its ratification the categories to which the application is extended and the modifications, if any, rendered necessary.6. Each Member which has ratified this Convention may further subsequently notify the Director-General of the International Labour Office, by a declaration, that it extends the application of the Convention to categories beyond those, if any, specified at the time of ratification.7. In so far as necessary, measures may be taken by the competent authority or through the appropriate machinery in a country, after consultation with the organisations of shipowners and seafarers concerned, where such exist, to exclude from the application of this Convention limited categories of persons employed on board sea-going ships.8. Each Member which ratifies this Convention shall list, in the first report on the application of the Convention submitted under Article 22 of the Constitution of the International Labour Organisation, any categories which may have been excluded in pursuance of paragraphs 3 and 7 of this Article, giving the reasons for such exclusion, and shall state in subsequent reports the position of its law and practice in respect of the categories excluded and the extent to which effect has been given or is proposed to be given to the Convention in respect of such categories.Article 31. Every seafarer to whom this Convention applies shall be entitled to annual leave with pay of a specified minimum length.2. Each Member which ratifies this Convention shall specify the length of the annual leave in a declaration appended to its ratification.3. The leave shall in no case be less than 30 calendar days for one year of service.4. Each Member which has ratified this Convention may subsequently notify the Director-General of the International Labour Office, by a further declaration, that it specifies annual leave longer than that specified at the time of ratification.Article 41. A seafarer whose length of service in any year is less than that required for the full entitlement prescribed in the preceding Article shall be entitled in respect of that year to annual leave with pay proportionate to his length of service during that year.2. The expression year in this Convention shall mean the calendar year or any other period of the same length.Article 51. The manner in which the length of service is calculated for the purpose of leave entitlement shall be determined by the competent authority or through the appropriate machinery in each country.2. Under conditions to be determined by the competent authority or through the appropriate machinery in each country, service off articles shall be counted as part of the period of service.3. Under conditions to be determined by the competent authority or through the appropriate machinery in each country, absence from work to attend an approved maritime vocational training course or for such reasons beyond the control of the seafarer concerned as illness, injury or maternity shall be counted as part of the period of service.Article 6The following shall not be counted as part of the minimum annual leave with pay prescribed in Article 3, paragraph 3, of this Convention:(a) public and customary holidays recognised as such in the country of the flag, whether or not they fall during the annual leave with pay;(b) periods of incapacity for work resulting from illness, injury or maternity, under conditions to be determined by the competent authority or through the appropriate machinery in each country;(c) temporary shore leave granted to a seafarer while on articles;(d) compensatory leave of any kind, under conditions to be determined by the competent authority or through the appropriate machinery in each country.Article 71. Every seafarer taking the annual leave envisaged in this Convention shall receive in respect of the full period of that leave at least his normal remuneration (including the cash equivalent of any part of that remuneration which is paid in kind), calculated in a manner to be determined by the competent authority or through the appropriate machinery in each country.2. The amounts due in pursuance of paragraph 1 of this Article shall be paid to the seafarer concerned in advance of the leave, unless otherwise provided by national laws or regulations or in an agreement applicable to him and the employer.3. A seafarer who leaves or is discharged from the service of his employer before he has taken annual leave due to him shall receive in respect of such leave due to him the remuneration provided for in paragraph 1 of this Article.Article 81. The division of the annual leave with pay into parts, or the accumulation of such annual leave due in respect of one year together with a subsequent period of leave, may be authorised by the competent authority or through the appropriate machinery in each country.2. Subject to paragraph 1 of this Article and unless otherwise provided in an agreement applicable to the employer and the seafarer concerned, the annual leave with pay prescribed by this Convention shall consist of an uninterrupted period.Article 9In exceptional cases, provision may be made by the competent authority or through the appropriate machinery in each country for the substitution for annual leave due in virtue of this Convention of a cash payment at least equivalent to the remuneration provided for in Article 7.Article 101. The time at which the leave is to be taken shall, unless it is fixed by regulation, collective agreement, arbitration award or other means consistent with national practice, be determined by the employer after consultation and, as far as possible, in agreement with the seafarer concerned or his representatives.2. No seafarer shall be required without his consent to take annual leave due to him at a place other than that where he was engaged or recruited, whichever is nearer his home, except under the provisions of a collective agreement or of national laws or regulations.3. If a seafarer is required to take his annual leave from a place other than that permitted by paragraph 2 of this Article, he shall be entitled to free transportation to the place where he was engaged or recruited, whichever is nearer his home, and subsistence and other costs directly involved in his return there shall be for the account of the employer; the travel time involved shall not be deducted from the annual leave with pay due to the seafarer.Article 11Any agreement to relinquish the right to the minimum annual leave with pay prescribed in Article 3, paragraph 3, or--except as provided, exceptionally, in pursuance of Article 9 of this Convention--to forgo such leave, shall be null and void.Article 12A seafarer taking annual leave shall be recalled only in cases of extreme emergency, with due notice.Article 13Effective measures appropriate to the manner in which effect is given to the provisions of this Convention shall be taken to ensure the proper application and enforcement of regulations or provisions concerning annual leave with pay, by means of adequate inspection or otherwise.Article 14This Convention revises the Paid Vacations (Seafarers) Convention (Revised), 1949.Article 15The formal ratifications of this Convention shall be communicated to the Director-General of the International Labour Office for registration.Article 161. This Convention shall be binding only upon those Members of the International Labour Organisation whose ratifications have been registered with the Director-General.2.

Should the Conference adopt a new Convention revising this Convention in whole or in part, then, unless the new Convention otherwise provides: (a) the ratification by a Member of the new revising Convention shall ipso jure involve the immediate denunciation of this Convention, notwithstanding the provisions of Article 17 above, if and when the new revising Convention shall have come into force;(b) as from the date when the new revising Convention comes into force this Convention shall cease to be open to ratification by the Members.2. This Convention shall in any case remain in force in its actual form and content for those Members which have ratified it but have not ratified the revising Convention.Article 22The English and French versions of the text of this Convention are equally authoritative.","C146: Seafarers' Annual Leave with Pay Convention, 1976"

GENERAL PROVISIONSArticle 1In this Convention:(a) the term legislation includes any social security rules as well as laws and regulations;(b) the term prescribed means determined by or in virtue of national legislation.Article 2Each Member shall take appropriate steps to co-ordinate its system of protection against unemployment and its employment policy. To this end, it shall seek to ensure that its system of protection against unemployment, and in particular the methods of providing unemployment benefit, contribute to the promotion of full, productive and freely chosen employment, and are not such as to discourage employers from offering and workers from seeking productive employment.Article 3The provisions of this Convention shall be implemented in consultation and co-operation with the organisations of employers and workers, in accordance with national practice.Article 41. Each Member which ratifies this Convention may, by a declaration accompanying its ratification, exclude the provisions of Part VII from the obligations accepted by ratification.2. Each Member which has made a declaration under paragraph 1 above may withdraw it at any time by a subsequent declaration.Article 51.

Such a declaration shall state the reasons which justify these exceptions.2. Notwithstanding the provisions of paragraph 1 above, a Member, where it is justified by the extent of protection of its social security system, may avail itself, by a declaration accompanying its ratification, of the temporary exceptions provided for in Article 10, paragraph 4, Article 11, paragraph 3, Article 15, paragraph 2, Article 18, paragraph 2, Article 19, paragraph 4, Article 23, paragraph 2, Article 24, paragraph 2 and Article 25, paragraph 2. Such a declaration shall state the reasons which justify these exceptions.3. Each Member which has made a declaration under paragraph 1 or paragraph 2 shall include in its reports on the application of this Convention submitted under article 22 of the Constitution of the International Labour Organisation a statement in respect of each exception of which it avails itself- (a) that its reason for doing so subsists; or(b) that it renounces its right to avail itself of the exception in question as from a stated date.4.

Each Member shall ensure equality of treatment for all persons protected, without discrimination on the basis of race, colour, sex, religion, political opinion, national extraction, nationality, ethnic or social origin, disability or age.2. The provisions of paragraph 1 shall not prevent the adoption of special measures which are justified by the circumstances of identified groups under the schemes referred to in Article 12, paragraph 2, or are designed to meet the specific needs of categories of persons who have particular problems in the labour market, in particular disadvantaged groups, or the conclusion between States of bilateral or multilateral agreements relating to unemployment benefits on the basis of reciprocity.II.

Each Member shall specify, in its reports under article 22 of the Constitution of the International Labour Organisation, the categories of persons for whom it undertakes to promote employment programmes.3. Each Member shall endeavour to extend the promotion of productive employment progressively to a greater number of categories than the number initially covered.Article 9The measures envisaged in this Part shall be taken in the light of the Human Resources Development Convention and Recommendation, 1975, and the Employment Policy (supplementary Provisions) Recommendation, 1984.III. CONTINGENCIES COVEREDArticle 101. The contingencies covered shall include, under prescribed conditions, full unemployment defined as the loss of earnings due to inability to obtain suitable employment with due regard to the provisions of Article 21, paragraph 2, in the case of a person capable of working, available for work and actually seeking work.2. Each Member shall endeavour to extend the protection of the Convention, under prescribed conditions, to the following contingencies - (a) loss of earnings due to partial unemployment, defined as a temporary reduction in the normal or statutory hours of work; and(b) suspension or reduction of earnings due to a temporary suspension of work, without any break in the employment relationship for reasons of, in particular, an economic, technological, structural or similar nature.3. Each Member shall in addition endeavour to provide the payment of benefits to part-time workers who are actually seeking full-time work. The total of benefits and earnings from their part-time work may be such as to maintain incentives to take up full-time work.4. Where a declaration made in virtue of Article 5 is in force, the implementation of paragraphs 2 and 3 above may be deferred.IV. PERSONS PROTECTEDArticle 111. The persons protected shall comprise prescribed classes of employees, constituting not less than 85 per cent of all employees, including public employees and apprentices.2. Notwithstanding the provisions of paragraph 1 above, public employees whose employment up to normal retiring age is guaranteed by national laws or regulations may be excluded from protection.3. Where a declaration made in virtue of Article 5 is in force, the persons protected shall comprise- (a) prescribed classes of employees constituting not less than 50 per cent of all employees; or(b) where specifically justified by the level of development, prescribed classes of employees constituting not less than 50 per cent of all employees in industrial workplaces employing 20 persons or more.V. METHODS OF PROTECTIONArticle 121. Unless it is otherwise provided in this Convention, each Member may determine the method or methods of protection by which it chooses to put into effect the provisions of the Convention, whether by a contributory or non-contributory system, or by a combination of such systems.2. Nevertheless, if the legislation of a Member protects all residents whose resources, during the contingency, do not exceed prescribed limits, the protection afforded may be limited, in the light of the resources of the beneficiary and his or her family, in accordance with the provisions of Article 16.VI. BENEFIT TO BE PROVIDEDArticle 13Benefits provided in the form of periodical payments to the unemployed may be related to the methods of protection.Article 14In cases of full unemployment, benefits shall be provided in the form of periodical payments calculated in such a way as to provide the beneficiary with partial and transitional wage replacement and, at the same time, to avoid creating disincentives either to work or to employment creation.Article 151. In cases of full unemployment and suspension of earnings due to a temporary suspension of work without any break in the employment relationship, when this contingency is covered, benefits shall be provided in the form of periodical payments, calculated as follows: (a) where these benefits are based on the contributions of or on behalf of the person protected or on previous earnings, they shall be fixed at not less than 50 per cent of previous earnings, it being permitted to fix a maximum for the amount of the benefit or for the earnings to be taken into account, which may be related, for example, to the wage of a skilled manual employee or to the average wage of workers in the region concerned;(b) where such benefits are not based on contributions or previous earnings, they shall be fixed at not less than 50 per cent of the statutory minimum wage or of the wage of an ordinary labourer, or at a level which provides the minimum essential for basic living expenses, whichever is the highest;2. Where a declaration made in virtue of Article 5 is in force, the amount of the benefits shall be equal- (a) to not less than 45 per cent of the previous earnings; or(b) to not less than 45 per cent of the statutory minimum wage or of the wage of an ordinary labourer but no less than a level which provides the minimum essential for basic living expenses.3. If appropriate, the percentages specified in paragraphs 1 and 2 may be reached by comparing net periodical payments after tax and contributions with net earnings after tax and contributions.Article 16Notwithstanding the provisions of Article 15, the benefit provided beyond the initial period specified in Article 19, paragraph 2 (a), as well as benefits paid by a Member in accordance with Article 12, paragraph 2, may be fixed after taking account of other resources, beyond a prescribed limit, available to the beneficiary and his or her family, in accordance with a prescribed scale. In any case, these benefits, in combination with any other benefits to which they may be entitled, shall guarantee them healthy and reasonable living conditions in accordance with national standards.Article 171. Where the legislation of a Member makes the right to unemployment benefit conditional upon the completion of a qualifying period, this period shall not exceed the length deemed necessary to prevent abuse.2. Each Member shall endeavour to adapt the qualifying period to the occupational circumstances of seasonal workers.Article 181. If the legislation of a Member provides that the payment of benefit in cases of full unemployment should begin only after the expiry of a waiting period, such period shall not exceed seven days.2. Where a declaration made in virtue of Article 5 is in force, the length of the waiting period shall not exceed ten days.3. In the case of seasonal workers the waiting period specified in paragraph 1 above may be adapted to their occupational circumstances.Article 191. The benefits provided in cases of full unemployment and suspension of earnings due to a temporary suspension of work without any break in the employment relationship shall be paid throughout these contingencies.2. Nevertheless, in the case of full unemployment- (a) the initial duration of payment of the benefit provided for in Article 15 may be limited to 26 weeks in each spell of unemployment, or to 39 weeks over any period of 24 months;(b) in the event of unemployment continuing beyond this initial period of benefit, the duration of payment of benefit, which may be calculated in the light of the resources of the beneficiary and his or her family in accordance with the provisions of Article 16, may be limited to a prescribed period.3. If the legislation of a Member provides that the initial duration of payment of the benefit provided for in Article 15 shall vary with the length of the qualifying period, the average duration fixed for the payment of benefits shall be at least 26 weeks.4. Where a declaration made in virtue of Article 5 is in force, the duration of payment of benefit may be limited to 13 weeks over any periods of 12 months or to an average of 13 weeks if the legislation provides that the initial duration of payment shall vary with the length of the qualifying period.5. In the cases envisaged in paragraph 2 (b) above each Member shall endeavour to grant appropriate additional assistance to the persons concerned with a view to permitting them to find productive and freely chosen employment, having recourse in particular to the measures specified in Part II.6. The duration of payment of benefit to seasonal workers may be adapted to their occupational circumstances, without prejudice to the provisions of paragraph 2 (b) above.Article 20The benefit to which a protected person would have been entitled in the cases of full or partial unemployment or suspension of earnings due to a temporary suspension of work without any break in the employment relationship may be refused, withdrawn, suspended or reduced to the extent prescribed-(a) for as long as the person concerned is absent from the territory of the Member;(b) when it has been determined by the competent authority that the person concerned had deliberately contributed to his or her own dismissal;(c) when it has been determined by the competent authority that the person concerned has left employment voluntarily without just cause;(d) during the period of a labour dispute, when the person concerned has stopped work to take part in a labour dispute or when he or she is prevented from working as a direct result of a stoppage of work due to this labour dispute;(e) when the person concerned has attempted to obtain or has obtained benefits fraudulently;(f) when the person concerned has failed without just cause to use the facilities available for placement, vocational guidance, training, retraining or redeployment in suitable work;(g) as long as the person concerned is in receipt of another income maintenance benefit provided for in the legislation of the Member concerned, except a family benefit, provided that the part of the benefit which is suspended does not exceed that other benefit.Article 211. The benefit to which a protected person would have been entitled in the case of full unemployment may be refused, withdrawn, suspended or reduced, to the extent prescribed, when the person concerned refuses to accept suitable employment.2. In assessing the suitability of employment, account shall be taken, in particular, under prescribed conditions and to an appropriate extent, of the age of unemployed persons, their length of service in their former occupation, their acquired experience, the length of their period of unemployment, the labour market situation, the impact of the employment in question on their personal and family situation and whether the employment is vacant as a direct result of a stoppage of work due to an on-going labour dispute.Article 22When protected persons have received directly from their employer or from any other source under national laws or regulations or collective agreements, severance pay, the principal purpose of which is to contribute towards compensating them for the loss of earnings suffered in the event of full unemployment-(a) the unemployment benefit to which the persons concerned would be entitled may be suspended for a period corresponding to that during which the severance pay compensates for the loss of earnings suffered; or(b) the severance pay may be reduced by an amount corresponding to the value converted into a lump sum of the unemployment benefit to which the persons concerned are entitled for a period corresponding to that during which the severance pay compensates for the loss of earnings suffered,as each Member may decide.Article 231. Each Member whose legislation provides for the right to medical care and makes it directly or indirectly conditional upon occupational activity shall endeavour to ensure, under prescribed conditions, the provision of medical care to persons in receipt of unemployment benefit and to their dependants.2. Where a declaration made in virtue of Article 5 is in force, the implementation of paragraph 1 above may be deferred.Article 241. Each Member shall endeavour to guarantee to persons in receipt of unemployment benefit, under prescribed conditions, that the periods during which benefits are paid will be taken into consideration- (a) for acquisition of the right to and, where appropriate, calculation of disability, old-age and survivors' benefit, and(b) for acquisition of the right to medical care and sickness, maternity and family benefit after the end of unemployment,when the legislation of the Member concerned provides for such benefits and makes them directly or indirectly conditional upon occupational activity.2. Where a declaration made in virtue of Article 5 is in force, the implementation of paragraph 1 above may be deferred.Article 251. Each Member shall ensure that statutory social security schemes which are based on occupational activity are adjusted to the occupational circumstances of part-time workers, unless their hours of work or earnings can be considered, under prescribed conditions, as negligible.2. Where a declaration made in virtue of Article 5 is in force, the implementation of paragraph 1 above may be deferred.VII. SPECIAL PROVISIONS FOR NEW APPLICANTS FOR EMPLOYMENTArticle 261. Members shall take account of the fact that there are many categories of persons seeking work who have never been, or have ceased to be, recognised as unemployed or have never been, or have ceased to be, covered by schemes for the protection of the unemployed. Consequently, at least three of the following ten categories of persons seeking work shall receive social benefits, in accordance with prescribed terms and conditions: (a) young persons who have completed their vocational training;(b) young persons who have completed their studies;(c) young persons who have completed their compulsory military service;(d) persons after a period devoted to bringing up a child or caring for someone who is sick, disabled or elderly;(e) persons whose spouse had died, when they are not entitled to a survivor's benefit;(f) divorced or separated persons;(g) released prisoners;(h) adults, including disabled persons, who have completed a period of training;(i) migrant workers on return to their home country, except in so far as they have acquired rights under the legislation of the country where they last worked;(j) previously self-employed persons.2. Each Member shall specify, in its reports under article 22 of the Constitution of the International Labour Organisation, the categories of persons listed in paragraph 1 above which it undertakes to protect.3. Each Member shall endeavour to extend protection progressively to a greater number of categories than the number initially protected.VIII. LEGAL, ADMINISTRATIVE AND FINANCIAL GUARANTEESArticle 271. In the event of refusal, withdrawal, suspension or reduction of benefit or dispute as to its amount, claimants shall have the right to present a complaint to the body administering the benefit scheme and to appeal thereafter to an independent body. They shall be informed in writing of the procedures available, which shall be simple and rapid.2. The appeal procedure shall enable the claimant, in accordance with national law and practice, to be represented or assisted by a qualified person of the claimant's choice or by a delegate of a representative workers' organisation or by a delegate of an organisation representative of protected persons.Article 28Each Member shall assume general responsibility for the sound administration of the institutions and services entrusted with the application of the Convention.Article 291. When the administration is directly entrusted to a government department responsible to Parliament, representatives of the protected persons and of the employers shall be associated in the administration in an advisory capacity, under prescribed conditions.2. When the administration is not entrusted to a government department responsible to Parliament- (a) representatives of the protected persons shall participate in the administration or be associated therewith in an advisory capacity under prescribed conditions;(b) national laws or regulations may also provide for the participation of employers' representatives;(c) the laws or regulations may further provide for the participation of representatives of the public authorities.Article 30In cases where subsidies are granted by the State or the social security system in order to safeguard employment, Members shall take the necessary steps to ensure that the payments are expended only for the intended purpose and to prevent fraud or abuse by those who receive such payments.Article 31This Convention revises the Unemployment Provision Convention, 1934.Article 32The formal ratifications of this Convention shall be communicated to the Director-General of the International Labour Office for registration.Article 331.

GENERAL PROVISIONSArticle 11. For the purposes of this Convention, the term insolvency refers to situations in which, in accordance with national law and practice, proceedings have been opened relating to an employer's assets with a view to the collective reimbursement of its creditors.2. For the purposes of this Convention, a Member may extend the term ""insolvency"" to other situations in which workers' claims cannot be paid by reason of the financial situation of the employer, for example where the amount of the employer's assets is recognised as being insufficient to justify the opening of insolvency proceedings.3. The extent to which an employer's assets are subject to the proceedings referred to in paragraph 1 above shall be determined by national laws, regulations or practice.Article 2The provisions of this Convention shall be applied by means of laws or regulations or by any other means consistent with national practice.Article 31. A Member which ratifies this Convention shall accept either the obligations of Part II, providing for the protection of workers' claims by means of a privilege, or the obligations of Part III, providing for the protection of workers' claims by a guarantee institution, or the obligations of both Parts. This choice shall be indicated in a declaration accompanying its ratification.2. A Member which has initially accepted only Part II or only Part III of this Convention may thereafter, by a declaration communicated to the Director-General of the International Labour Office, extend its acceptance to the other Part.3. A Member which accepts the obligations of both Parts of this Convention may, after consulting the most representative organisations of employers and workers, limit the application of Part III to certain categories of workers and to certain branches of economic activity. Such limitations shall be specified in the declaration of acceptance.4. A Member which has limited its acceptance of the obligations of Part III in accordance with paragraph 3 above shall, in its first report under article 22 of the Constitution of the International Labour Organisation, give the reasons for limiting its acceptance. In subsequent reports it shall provide information on any extension of the protection under Part III of this Convention to other categories of workers or other branches of economic activity.5. A Member which has accepted the obligations of Parts II and III of this Convention may, after consulting the most representative organisations of employers and workers, exclude from the application of Part II those claims which are protected pursuant to Part III.6.

A Member which has accepted only the obligations of Part III of this Convention may, by a declaration communicated to the Director-General of the International Labour Office, terminate its obligations under Article 11 of the Protection of Wages Convention, 1949, in respect of those claims which are protected pursuant to Part III.Article 41. Subject to the exceptions provided for in paragraph 2 below, and to any limitations specified in accordance with Article 3, paragraph 3, this Convention shall apply to all employees and to all branches of economic activity.2. The competent authority, after consulting the most representative organisations of employers and workers, may exclude from Part II, Part III or both Parts of this Convention specific categories of workers, in particular public employees, by reason of the particular nature of their employment relationship, or if there are other types of guarantee affording them protection equivalent to that provided by the Convention.3. A Member availing itself of the exceptions provided for in paragraph 2 above shall, in its reports under article 22 of the Constitution of the International Labour Organisation, provide information on such exceptions, giving the reasons therefor.PART II. PROTECTION OF WORKERS' CLAIMS BY MEANS OF A PRIVILEGEPROTECTED CLAIMSArticle 5In the event of an employer's insolvency, workers' claims arising out of their employment shall be protected by a privilege so that they are paid out of the assets of the insolvent employer before non-privileged creditors can be paid their share.Article 6The privilege shall cover at least:(a) the workers' claims for wages relating to a prescribed period, which shall not be less than three months, prior to the insolvency or prior to the termination of the employment;(b) the workers' claims for holiday pay due as a result of work performed during the year in which the insolvency or the termination of the employment occurred, and in the preceding year;(c) the workers' claims for amounts due in respect of other types of paid absence relating to a prescribed period, which shall not be less than three months, prior to the insolvency or prior to the termination of the employment;(d) severance pay due to workers upon termination of their employment.LIMITATIONSArticle 71.

The proof of nationality or permanent residence will normally consist of the applicant's passport or certificate of admission as a permanent resident.3.8. Applicants should be asked to declare all other nationalities that they may possess and affirm that they have not been issued with and have not applied for a SID from any other Member.3.9. The applicant should not be issued with a SID for so long as he or she possesses another SID. 3.9.1. An early renewal system should apply in circumstances where a seafarer is aware in advance that the period of service is such that he or she will be unable to make his or her application at the date of expiry or renewal;3.9.2. An extension system should apply in circumstances where an extension of a SID is required due to an unforeseen extension of the period of service;3.9.3. A replacement system should apply in circumstances where a SID is lost. A suitable temporary document can be issued.3.10. The proof that the applicant is a seafarer, within the meaning of Article 1 of this Convention should at least consist of: 3.10.1. a previous SID, or a seafarers' discharge book; or3.10.2. a certificate of competency, qualification or other relevant training; or3.10.3. equally cogent evidence.3.11.

The official referred to in section 3.12 above should prepare brief notes for the record indicating the results of each of the above verifications, and drawing attention to the facts that justify the conclusion that the applicant is a seafarer.3.14. Once fully checked, the application, accompanied by the supporting documents and the notes for the record, should be forwarded to the official responsible for completion of the SID to be issued to the applicant.3.15. The completed SID, accompanied by the related file in the issuing authority, should then be forwarded to a senior official of that authority for approval.3.16. The senior official should give such approval only if satisfied, after review of at least the notes for the record, that the procedures have been properly followed and that the issuance of the SID to the applicant is justified.3.17. This approval should be given in writing and be accompanied by explanations concerning any features of the application that need special consideration.3.18. The SID (together with the passport or similar document provided) should be handed to the applicant directly against receipt, or sent to the applicant or, if the latter has so requested, to his or her shipmaster or employer in both cases by reliable postal communication requiring advice of receipt.3.19. When the SID is issued to the applicant, the particulars specified in Annex II to the Convention should be entered in the database referred to in Article 4 of the Convention.3.20. The rules of the issuing authority should specify a maximum period for receipt after dispatch. If advice of receipt is not received within that period and after due notification of the seafarer, an appropriate annotation should be made in the database and the SID should be officially reported as lost and the seafarer informed.3.21. All annotations to be made, such as, in particular, the brief notes for the record (see section 3.13 above) and the explanations referred to in section 3.17, should be kept in a safe place during the period of validity of the SID and for three years afterwards. Those annotations and explanations required by section 3.17 should be recorded in a separate internal database, and rendered accessible: (a) to persons responsible for monitoring operations; (b) to officials involved in the review of applications for SIDs; and (c) for training purposes.3.22. When information is received suggesting that a SID was wrongly issued or that the conditions for its issue are no longer applicable, the matter should be promptly notified to the issuing authority with a view to its rapid withdrawal.3.23. When a SID is suspended or withdrawn the issuing authority should immediately update its database to indicate that this SID is not currently recognized.3.24. If an application for a SID is refused or a decision is taken to suspend or withdraw a SID, the applicant should be officially informed of his or her right of appeal and fully informed of the reasons for the decision.3.25. The procedures for appeal should be as rapid as possible and consistent with the need for fair and complete consideration.4. Operation, security and maintenance of the database 4.1.

SCOPE AND DEFINITIONSArticle 11. This Convention applies to every seagoing ship, whether publicly or privately owned, which is registered in the territory of any Member for which the Convention is in force and is ordinarily engaged in commercial maritime operations. For the purpose of this Convention, a ship that is on the register of two Members is deemed to be registered in the territory of the Member whose flag it flies.2. To the extent it deems practicable, after consulting the representative organizations of fishing-vessel owners and fishermen, the competent authority shall apply the provisions of this Convention to commercial maritime fishing.3. In the event of doubt as to whether or not any ships are to be regarded as seagoing ships or engaged in commercial maritime operations or commercial maritime fishing for the purpose of the Convention, the question shall be determined by the competent authority after consulting the organizations of shipowners, seafarers and fishermen concerned.4. This Convention does not apply to wooden vessels of traditional build such as dhows and junks.Article 2For the purpose of this Convention:(a) the term competent authority means the minister, government department or other authority having power to issue regulations, orders or other instructions having the force of law in respect of seafarers' hours of work or rest or the manning of ships;(b) the term hours of work means time during which a seafarer is required to do work on account of the ship;(c) the term hours of rest means time outside hours of work; this term does not include short breaks;(d) the term seafarer means any person defined as such by national laws or regulations or collective agreements who is employed or engaged in any capacity on board a seagoing ship to which this Convention applies;(e) the term shipowner means the owner of the ship or any other organization or person, such as the manager or bareboat charterer, who has assumed the responsibility for the operation of the ship from the shipowner and who on assuming such responsibility has agreed to take over all the attendant duties and responsibilities.PART II. SEAFARERS' HOURS OF WORK AND HOURS OF RESTArticle 3Within the limits set out in Article 5, there shall be fixed either a maximum number of hours of work which shall not be exceeded in a given period of time, or a minimum number of hours of rest which shall be provided in a given period of time.Article 4A Member which ratifies this Convention acknowledges that the normal working hours' standard for seafarers, like that for other workers, shall be based on an eight-hour day with one day of rest per week and rest on public holidays. However, this shall not prevent the Member from having procedures to authorize or register a collective agreement which determines seafarers' normal working hours on a basis no less favourable than this standard.Article 51. The limits on hours of work or rest shall be as follows: (a) maximum hours of work shall not exceed: (i) 14 hours in any 24-hour period; and(ii) 72 hours in any seven-day period;or(b) minimum hours of rest shall not be less than: (i) ten hours in any 24-hour period; and(ii) 77 hours in any seven-day period.2. Hours of rest may be divided into no more than two periods, one of which shall be at least six hours in length, and the interval between consecutive periods of rest shall not exceed 14 hours.3. Musters, fire-fighting and lifeboat drills, and drills prescribed by national laws and regulations and by international instruments shall be conducted in a manner that minimizes the disturbance of rest periods and does not induce fatigue.4. In respect of situations when a seafarer is on call, such as when a machinery space is unattended, the seafarer shall have an adequate compensatory rest period if the normal period of rest is disturbed by call-outs to work.5. If no collective agreement or arbitration award exists or if the competent authority determines that the provisions in the agreement or award in respect of paragraph 3 or 4 are inadequate, the competent authority shall determine such provisions to ensure the seafarers concerned have sufficient rest.6. Nothing in paragraphs 1 and 2 shall prevent the Member from having national laws or regulations or a procedure for the competent authority to authorize or register collective agreements permitting exceptions to the limits set out. Such exceptions shall, as far as possible, follow the standards set out but may take account of more frequent or longer leave periods or the granting of compensatory leave for watchkeeping seafarers or seafarers working on board ships on short voyages.7. The Member shall require the posting, in an easily accessible place, of a table with the shipboard working arrangements, which shall contain for every position at least: (a) the schedule of service at sea and service in port; and(b) the maximum hours of work or the minimum hours of rest required by the laws, regulations or collective agreements in force in the flag State.8. The table referred to in paragraph 7 shall be established in a standardized format in the working language or languages of the ship and in English.Article 6No seafearer under 18 years of age shall work at night. For the purpose of this Article, night means a period of at least nine consecutive hours, including the interval from midnight to five a.m. This provision need not be applied when the effective training of young seafarers between the ages of 16 and 18 in accordance with established programmes and schedules would be impaired.Article 71. Nothing in this Convention shall be deemed to impair the right of the master of a ship to require a seafarer to perform any hours of work necessary for the immediate safety of the ship, persons on board or cargo, or for the purpose of giving assistance to other ships or persons in distress at sea.2. In accordance with paragraph 1, the master may suspend the schedule of hours of work or hours of rest and require a seafarer to perform any hours of work necessary until the normal situation has been restored.3. As soon as practicable after the normal situation has been restored, the master shall ensure that any seafarers who have performed work in a scheduled rest period are provided with an adequate period of rest.Article 81. The Member shall require that records of seafarers' daily hours of work or of their daily hours of rest be maintained to allow monitoring of compliance with the provisions set out in Article 5. The seafarer shall receive a copy of the records pertaining to him or her which shall be endorsed by the master, or a person authorized by the master, and by the seafarer.2. The competent authority shall determine the procedures for keeping such records on board, including the intervals at which the information shall be recorded. The competent authority shall establish the format of the records of the seafarers' hours of work or of their hours of rest taking into account any available International Labour Organization guidelines or shall use any standard format prepared by the Organization. The format shall be established in the language or languages provided by Article 5, paragraph 8.3. A copy of the relevant provisions of the national legislation pertaining to this Convention and the relevant collective agreements shall be kept on board and be easily accessible to the crew.Article 9The competent authority shall examine and endorse the records referred to in Article 8, at appropriate intervals, to monitor compliance with the provisions governing hours of work or hours of rest that give effect to this Convention.Article 10If the records or other evidence indicate infringement of provisions governing hours of work or hours of rest, the competent authority shall require that measures, including if necessary the revision of the manning of the ship, are taken so as to avoid future infringements.PART III. MANNING OF SHIPSArticle 111. Every ship to which this Convention applies shall be sufficiently, safely and efficiently manned, in accordance with the minimum safe manning document or an equivalent issued by the competent authority.2. When determining, approving or revising manning levels, the competent authority shall take into account: (a) the need to avoid or minimize, as far as practicable, excessive hours of work, to ensure sufficient rest and to limit fatigue; and(b) the international instruments identified in the Preamble.Article 12No person under 16 years of age shall work on a ship.PART IV. RESPONSIBILITIES OF SHIPOWNERS AND MASTERSArticle 13The shipowner shall ensure that the master is provided with the necessary resources for the purpose of compliance with obligations under this Convention, including those relating to the appropriate manning of the ship. The master shall take all necessary steps to ensure that the requirements on seafarers' hours of work and rest arising from this Convention are complied with.PART V. APPLICATIONArticle 14A Member which ratifies this Convention shall be responsible for the application of its provisions by means of laws or regulations, except where effect is given by collective agreements, arbitration awards or court decisions.Article 15The Member shall:(a) take all necessary measures, including the provision of appropriate sanctions and corrective measures, to ensure the effective enforcement of the provisions of this Convention;(b) have appropriate inspection services to supervise the application of the measures taken in pursuance of this Convention and provide them with the necessary resources for this purpose; and(c) after consulting shipowners' and seafarers' organizations, have procedures to investigate complaints relating to any matter contained in this Convention.PART VI.
